# - The Handler to process the request. If no validation is required, use the PassthroughHandler.
#   To validate requests, subclass PassthroughHandler and validate before passing onto PassthroughHandler
# - Cassandra information. This hash contains the information required by PassthroughHandler to store
#   the data in the underlying database. Namely:
#     - table: the table to store the values in
#     - keys: a list of keys to use for the parameters passed in. These correspond one to one to
#       parameters from the capture groups in the route regex
