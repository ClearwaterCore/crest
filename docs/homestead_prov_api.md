# Homestead-prov - API Guide

Homestead-prov provides a RESTful API. This is used by the Ellis component to create/delete/query subscribers. It shouldn't be used if the deployment uses a real HSS. 

All access must go via this API, rather than directly to the database. 

## Liveness checking

    /ping

Make a GET request to this endpoint to check whether Homestead-prov is running. It will return 200 OK if so.

## IMPI

    /impi/<private ID>/digest

Make a GET request to this URL to retrieve the digest of the specified private ID

The URL takes an optional query parameter: `public_id=<public_id>` If specified a digest is only returned if the private ID is able to authenticate the public ID.

Response:

* 200 if the digest is found, returned as JSON: `{ "digest_ha1": "<DIGEST>" }`
* 404 if the digest is not found.

## IMPU

    /impu/<public ID>

Make a GET request to this URL to retrieve the IMS subscription document for this public ID

Response:

* 200 if the public ID is found, returned as an IMSSubscription XML document, e.g.:

    <IMSSubscription>
        <PrivateID>...</PrivateID>
        <ServiceProfile>
            <InitialFilterCriteria>
                <TriggerPoint>...</SPT></TriggerPoint>
                <ApplicationServer>
                    <ServerName>...</ServerName>
                </ApplicationServer>
            </InitialFilterCriteria>
            <PublicIdentity>
                <Identity>...</Identity>
            </PublicIdentity>
        </ServiceProfile>
    </IMSSubscription>

* 404 if the public ID is not found.

## Private ID

    /private/<private ID>

Make a PUT to this URL to create a new private ID or update an existing one. The private ID will store the digest of the subscriber's password, and it can optinally store the subscriber's password in plaintext as well.

The PUT request has a mandatory JSON body which has the format:

    { "digest_ha1": "<DIGEST>" [, "realm": "<REALM>"] }

or

    { "plaintext_password": "<PLAINTEXT_PASSWORD>" [, "realm": "<REALM>"] }

If `digest_ha1` is used, Homestead-prov will store this digest in the Private ID (note, this is the recommended method).
If `plaintext_password` is used, Homestead-prov will calculate the digest from the password, and store the digest and the password (in plain text) in the Private ID. This option is available for RCS integration (and ease-of-use for testing), but this is less secure and so should not be used unless you particularly need it.
If the realm is omitted, homestead-prov defaults it to the configured home domain.

Response:

* 200 if the private ID was created/updated successfully.
* 400 if the body of the request is invalid

If an existing private ID has stored the subscriber's password in plaintext, but it's then updated using `digest_ha1` call, then the password is deleted from the Private ID.

Make a GET to this URL to retrieve details for a private ID. Response:

* 200 if the private ID was found, returned as JSON:

    `{ "digest_ha1": "<DIGEST>", "plaintext_password": "<PLAINTEXT_PASSWORD>", "realm": "<REALM>" }`

  The `plaintext_password` value is only included if the subscriber was provisioned in a way to store the plaintext password.
* 404 if the private ID was not found.

Make a DELETE to this URL to delete an existing private ID. Response:

* 200 if the private ID was deleted successfully.
* 204 if the private ID could not be found.

    `/private/<private id>/associated_implicit_registration_sets/`

Make a GET to this URL to retrieve the IRSs that this private ID is configured to authenticate. Response:

* 200 if the private ID was found, returned as JSON: `{ "associated_implicit_registration_sets": ["<irs-uuid-1>", "<irs_uuid-2>"] }`
* 404 if the private ID could not be found.

    `/private/<private id>/associated_implicit_registration_sets/<irs-uuid>`

Make a PUT to this URL to configure the private ID to authenticate the specified IRS. Response:

* 200 if the private ID has been updated to authenticate the IRS.
* 404 if the private ID could not be found.

Make a DELETE to this URL to configure the private ID to no longer authenticate the specified IRS. Response:

* 200 if the private ID has been updated to _not_ authenticate the IRS.
* 204 if the private ID could not be found.

    `/private/<private ID>/associated_public_ids`

Make a GET to this URL to list the public IDs that the private ID can authenticate. Response:

* 200 if the private ID could be found, returned as JSON: `{ "associated_public_ids": ["<public-id-1>", "<public-id-2>"] }`
* 404 if the private ID could not be found.

`/public/?excludeuuids=[true|false]&chunk-proportion=N&chunk=M`

Make a GET to this URL to list all public IDs provisioned on the system.

Parameters:

* excludeuuids (boolean, default false) - This API can provide the service profile and implicit
    registration set UUIDs for each public ID. This requires more database lookups, so can be
    disabled for a faster, less CPU-intensive query if they aren't needed.
* chunk-proportion (integer, default 256) - Internally, Homestead breaks the subscriber base into
    this many chunks, and pauses for 1 second between querying each one. Reducing this value will
    result in a faster response, but will be less well-paced (with a higher risk of disrupting
    service), and as Homestead handles more data at once, results in higher memory usage. The value
    of 256 has proved to work well in testing.
* chunk (integer, default unset) - If set, this API only returns this chunk (i.e. a fraction of
    the total subscriber base).  Chunks are 0-indexed, and so run from `0` to
    `chunk-proportion - 1` - e.g. if you have 10000 subscribers and set `chunk-proportion=1000`, a
    query with `chunk=0` will return ~10 subscribers and a query with `chunk=1` will return another
    ~10 subscribers.  If absent, this API returns all chunks.

This API does a lot more work than the others, so it tends to be slower - as a rough guide, from
testing on a 1-core VM:

* retrieving 100k subscribers with excludeuuids=false takes 520 seconds - 264 seconds plus 256 1-second pauses for pacing
* retrieving 100k subscribers with excludeuuids=true takes 264 seconds - 8 seconds plus 256 1-second pauses for pacing

The response is always 200 OK, with a JSON body in the following form:

```
{"public_ids":
  [
    {"public_id": "sip:a@example.com",
     "sp": "fbfb0fa8-ac91-46a9-907a-1408fa0b521f",
     "irs": "51ca6207-9261-4199-aef0-8da6fb1fdafd"},
    {"public_id": "sip:b@example.com",
     "sp": "fbfb0fa8-ac91-46a9-907a-1408fa0b521f",
     "irs": "51ca6207-9261-4199-aef0-8da6fb1fdafd"},
]}
```

or, if excludeuuids is true:

```
{"public_ids":
  [
    {"public_id": "sip:a@example.com"},
    {"public_id": "sip:b@example.com"},
]}
```
